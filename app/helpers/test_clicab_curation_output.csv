The bill directed the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to set seasons and catch limits for commercial and noncommercial (sport) harvest of four species of turtles – common snapping, painted and softshells. It also directed the DNR to perform a population study of turtles in Iowa. “There is currently no season for the commercial or sport harvest of turtles,” Rep. Dean Fisher (R-Tama) told House members during his bill presentation. “Turtles can currently be harvested year round including during their nesting season. Commercial turtle harvesting currently has no bag limits. Sport harvesting has a limit of 100 pounds of live turtles or 50 pounds of dressed turtles.” Sport harvesting simply requires a fishing license. A sport harvester cannot sell the meat. Commercial harvest requires a commercial turtle harvest license for a $102 fee. “Over the past 30 years, the commercial harvest of turtles has risen from roughly 30,000 pounds in 1987 to over 238,000 pounds in 2013. This is a result of demand from the Far East where they have depleted their own turtle populations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Iowa’s turtle population is becoming depleted. Unfortunately there is no historical data that exists to determine what the impact has been,” added Fisher. Fisher reminded his colleagues that turtles are the only species lacking protection during nesting season. All other species of game animal are protected during nesting season when the wild animal cannot be legally harvested. Turtles are extremely vulnerable to predators. Once laid, the eggs are left on their own until they hatch. ""We should give turtles the same opportunity to reproduce that we give all other game animals without being molested,” concluded Fisher. This piece of legislation was not without controversy. The original version put a five-year moratorium on any harvesting of the four turtles. An amendment removed the moratorium and legislators successfully presented a compromise that would require the season and catch limits by commercial trappers. Even then, it had its opponents. Rep. Scott Ourth Rep. Dean Fisher P a g e | 22 “Never in a million years did I suspect the lowly turtle would gain such great notoriety in Iowa,” commented Rep. Scott Ourth (D-Warren), one of the bill’s champions. “Turtles may not be as majestic as a white-tailed deer with a 16-point rack, but they play every bit the integral role in the ecosystem.” The amendment passed on a voice vote. After the amendment passed, Ourth continued: “It’s the right thing to do. We protect all the other animals for table fare and for commerce. I would like to remind colleagues that six states surrounding Iowa have put a stop to all turtle harvest because they are losing the turtle.“","HF 2357 directs the Department of Natural Resources to set seasons and catch limits four species of turtles, safeguarding Iowa’s wildlife and the critical role they play in ecosystems.",Yea,0.0,0,,,HF,2357

Ross Paustian (R-Scott) included criminal penalties, including jail time, for illegal dumping and littering. The Chapter’s Legislative Committee opposed the bill, arguing that the penalties were too harsh. Several House Democrats also opposed the bill and brought the Sierra Club’s opposition declaration to the attention of the Environmental Protection Committee. Paustian was incredulous that the Sierra Club would oppose a littering bill. The House passed the bill 71-26 and then it went to the Senate. The Chapter continued to lobby against the criminal penalties. The Natural Resources committee considering the bill added an amendment that decriminalized penalties and replaced them with stiffer civil fines. The Chapter then changed its declaration to support and the Senate passed the bill 47-0.

276,IA,2016,regular,HF2351,,,SLDU SLDL,Funding water quality with water tax and Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund,"Water quality finally took center stage at the Iowa Legislature toward the end of the session. After disposing of most of the rest of their business, legislators began focusing attention on what to and how to spend Iowa’s coffers. Legislators were unhappy that Des Moines Water Works filed a lawsuit against three northwest Iowa counties. The perception was that the lawsuit pits the urban versus the rural so lawmakers realize something has to be done. Soon. They also realized that improving water quality requires money. Lots of money. Credit is due to legislators for being creative. Seven bills addressing water quality technically were still alive the first of April. Technically. But most of them didn’t go anywhere. Two bills did grab the attention of lawmakers. First, Gov. Terry Branstad proposed extending the one percent local option sales tax until 2050. The tax was enacted in 2008 as a vehicle to assist school districts address their crumbling infrastructure. Branstad’s proposal would divert $4.7 billion of that funding to water quality for the next 34 years. Of that share, 50 percent would be provided to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship’s (IDALS) Soil Conservation and Water Quality Division for a water quality infrastructure cost share program. The other 50 percent would be administered by the Iowa Finance Authority with 25 percent to the water quality financing program’s revolving loan program and 25 percent to wastewater and drinking water financial assistance program as grants. P a g e | 24 Rep. Tom Sands (R-Louisa), as chair of the Ways & Means Committee, proposed a different bill that would divert the tax collected on drinking water to the Iowa Finance Authority (IFA) rather than to the General Fund. It is expected the excise tax will bring in $284 million from FY2017 through FY2029. The formula would remain similar to the Governor’s proposal. The House Ways & Means Committee passed the bill then it went to House Appropriations. And that’s where it got a makeover. Rep. Pat Grassley (R-Butler) chairs House Appropriations. The proposal he presented retained the bill presented by the House Ways & Means Committee by distributing 15 percent of funds collected by IFA to the Water Quality Management Urban Cost-Share Account in IDALS and included an Urban Conservation Infrastructure Program. IFA would then provide 45 percent for the Water Quality Financing Program for a revolving loan program and 40 percent to Wastewater and Drinking Water Financial Assistance Program for grants. But there’s more. Grassley added an amendment that would take $184.5 million from the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund during the FY-17 through FY29 time frame. That’s in addition to the existing $736.69 million in funding IDALS currently receives for the Water Quality Infrastructure Program, Water Quality Non-Infrastructure Program and to Iowa State University for water quality research and measurements. Such a proposal would take away from other important projects the RIIF bill provides. According to the Iowa Code “Moneys in the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in a fiscal year shall be used as directed by the general assembly for public vertical infrastructure projects. For the purposes of this subsection, “vertical infrastructure” includes only land acquisition and construction; major renovation and major repair of buildings; routine, recurring maintenance; all appurtenant structures; utilities; site development; recreational trails; and debt service payments on academic revenue bonds issued in accordance with chapter 262A for capital projects at board of regents institutions. “Vertical infrastructure” does not include operational expenses or leasing of a building, appurtenant structure, or utility without a lease-purchase agreement.”",HF2351 would have taken $184.5 million from the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund to fund water quality improvements despite other available sources.,Neutral,0.0,0,no roll call votes found for this bill in LegiScan database,,HF,2351

HF2454 suspends the Water Improvement Resource Board (WIRB) since it hasn’t received funds since FY14. It does retain the language in the event any future funding will be available.

278,IA,2016,regular,SF2324,,,SLDU SLDL,Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund (RIIF),"McCoy, floor manager for Senate File 2324, ran down the highlights of millions of dollars in appropriations for infrastructure to which a conference committee comprised of five Representatives and five Senators could agree. Some of those projects include just under $9.5 million for major maintenance, $5.2 million for water quality financial assistance, $1.9 million to close agricultural drainage wells, $9.6 million for lake restoration and water quality, $1 million for low head dam removal and water trails and $300 thousand for state park infrastructure needs. Then he lamented that legislators did not have enough money to make many of the $300 million in needed repairs to buildings located at the Capitol complex. Appropriated in this year's budget is nearly $10 million for repairs on a leaking Capitol dome that is causing mortar issues that must be addressed. ""What was not debated [in the Conference Committee] is what to do with the current situation with the Historical building's [heating, ventilation and air conditioning] system, the water seeping through skylights and a bad roof design,"" he said. ""I had hope we could have pursued some option to address it as well as the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy's black mold problem and the issues at the Wallace Building that has high levels of lead, climate issues and elevators that have outlived their useful lifespan and need to be replaced."" McCoy had proposed to bond for those three buildings with gaming receipts spread out over 22 years but that proposal didn't fly in the House. McCoy said House Republicans and the Governor want to go with a pay-as-you-go system. He added that some of the Capitol complex buildings are in such disrepair that they probably would be shut down if they were private enterprise buildings. ""This year, this budget is absolutely under attack,"" McCoy said during closing remarks. ""This year the House Republicans proposed a $232 million transfer over the next decade out of this budget which would be $232 million that would not be available for state infrastructure had their proposal passed."" McCoy was referring to the House Appropriations Committee recommendation for providing water quality financial assistance. Sen. Matt McCoy P a g e | 26 As disappointed as McCoy appeared and sounded, he placed the responsibility for the poor conditions of the state's buildings squarely on the Governor's doorstep. ""When Gov. Branstad leaves, assuming he doesn’t run for re-election, he will have left the state that is in terrible condition from an infrastructure standpoint,"" concluded McCoy. ""And I think as a senior governor of the state of Iowa that has a legislature willing to work with him, that his legacy could have been that he left the state better than he found it. I don’t think he can say that.""","SF2324 appropriates funds for infrastructure.

For repeat offenses between ½ a cubic yard and 5 cubic yards in volume, the fines would increase by $500 for each additional offense, and the individual would be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a penal fine. If the litter exceeds 5 cubic yards, the fine would increase to $5,000 misdemeanor, with an increase to $10,000 for each subsequent similar violation. Fine revenue would be directed towards the local community group, municipal, county or township government taking responsibility for site clean-up.

Michigan is one of only two states that currently exempts the Executive from open record laws, Michigan’s current FOIA laws are outdated and insufficient. These bills do not entirely solve that problem. Generally speaking, the LORA bills contain language that mirrors current provisions in FOIA concerning other public bodies. However, there are provisions and exceptions in these bills unique to the legislative branch, notably the process for appealing decisions denying a request for disclosure of a public record under House Bill 4010, and limitations and exemptions from disclosure (Ex: constituent communications) in House Bill 4015. LORA would not apply to records pre-dating January 1, 2020.

Under the pending legislation, however, if the rainfall at or near the affected area or within the sewage disposal system service area is 1.7 inches or more in any one-hour period or 3.3 inches in any continuous 24-hour period then local government would be immune from property loss claims. This level of rainfall event can be expected to occur as often as every five years, so the bill would release governments from liability from relatively common precipitation events; mitigating accountability and citizen recourse for holding local governments responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of vital infrastructure.

This is a shift away from the original intent of voters for the NRTF to serve primarily as a land acquisition fund. Michiganders voted to constitutionally protect the NRTF because they recognized the importance of public lands to Michigan’s economy and quality of life. In addition, this bill would allow for the use of the NRTF monies to re-buy or provide “reimbursement” for land that is already in public ownership or is already providing public recreational benefit. Finally, this bill would require that the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) pursue NRTF funding prior to seeking any other funding source for a project.

These bills undermine Michigan’s public lands and outdoor legacy by diminishing the ability of the DNR to acquire and soundly manage public lands. The bills give local units of government veto power over state-level land acquisition decisions, require State payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILT) to be made (a legislative responsibility) before land can be acquired (an executive activity), and allow funds previously restricted to land acquisition to go towards land management and development projects. Additionally, the bills place restrictions on the DNR’s ability to manage existing land to protect or enhance biological diversity and ecosystem health. Finally, the bills require the DNR to do more public outreach about land management decisions, but they do not provide the DNR with new staff or resources to accomplish these added requirements.","Allows a mining permitee to relocate, recongifure, or modify mining facilities without obtaining an amendment to their mining permit ",Nay,0.0,0,,,SB,839

Reducing the lease charge to 1% of the current state equalized value of the lessee’s property or eliminating it all together would encourage breakwater construction and would hinder the DEQ’s ability to protect the public trust by setting an accurate lease price that takes into account both the impact a breakwater could have on the value to the property owner and on the public through the deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem.

Under this bill, an individual applying for a water withdrawal could circumvent the Site Specific Review process in Zone B (cold transitional streams) through the hiring of their own hydrogeologist who would analyze if the proposed withdrawal would have an ARI.

This is problematic because underlying draft EIS data is not subject to the Data Practices Act when prepared by a private regulated entity, which reduces public transparency and accountability of permitting. 2) Deny citizens contested case hearings on mining projects. A contested case hearing allows Minnesotans access to a hearing based on evidence and expert testimony. The provisions limit access to contested case hearings on mining permits for any Minnesotan who does not own property affected by a proposed mine. Examples of those who would lose their right to contest mine permits include: Local governments not identified in an application for a permit to mine, but whose drinking water supply could be affected by water pollution, people renting a home or cabin that would be affected by a proposed mine, people who fish or hunt on public lands/waters that would be affected by a proposed mine. 3) Exempt cities that build public water treatment facilities from having to make technological updates to comply with clean water standards for 16 years.

Senator Massey’s amendment was an attempt to circumvent the normal process for a bill to be approved by inserting it into the budget.

Peter McCoy, the Energy Freedom Act (H.3659) lifted the cap on solar energy development in South Carolina and opened up the clean energy marketplace. The Act addressed large-scale, commercial, and residential solar and renewable energy needs, as well as consumer protections. It established a policy of the State of South Carolina to promote solar energy and to ensure solar is accessible to all - regardless of income and home ownership. In addition, the Act deferred a number of long-term solar policy issues to the Public Service Commission.",,Yea,1.0,0,,,H,3659
1083,SC,2019,regular,H4152,,,SLDL,Pyrolysis,"Introduced by Representatives Hixon and other members of the House Agriculture and Natural Resource Committee, this bill sought to exempt pyrolysis facilities from existing Solid Waste Management laws. Pyrolysis is the melting and gasification of plastics into other petroleum products, like jet fuel. While this process is already permitted in South Carolina under existing law, the bill sought to exempt these facilities from Solid Waste oversight. The conservation community opposed the bill because of the lack of appropriate oversight of an unproven process, the lack of financial assurances to protect taxpayers if a facility contaminated the state or went bankrupt, and the potential to increase the import of out of state waste to satisfy the processing needs of the facilities. This bill had potentially significant and far-reaching impacts, but was complicated by plastic industry talking points that claimed that the process was “environmentally friendly” because it would keep plastic out of landfills.",,Nay,0.0,0,,,H,4152
1084,SC,2019,regular,H3700,,,SLDU SLDL,Seawalls,"Introduced by Representatives Bailey and Hewitt, H.3700 sought to allow the placement of wingwalls at the ends of existing erosion control structures, like seawalls. This bill was referred to the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs Committee. The Conservation Community had no position on the bill as drafted because it did not allow for the construction of new seawalls or erosion control structures on our coast. In the final days of the 2019 legislative year, however, Rep. Davey Hiott sponsored and passed an amendment to the bill that would have allowed the gated DeBordieu community to build a new seawall to protect 17 homes. This special interest provision would have undermined a 30-year prohibition on new sea walls along our coast and would have made it difficult to uphold critical legal protections for our coast. As a result, the conservation community opposed the bill as amended.",,Nay,0.0,0,,,H,3700

The bill was yet another attempt to reduce people’s ability to engage in the permitting process and protect their rights to a clean and healthy environment. The bill as proposed established a $5,000 filing fee for appeals of poultry permits, eliminated vegetative buffer requirements, limited the number of citizens with ‘standing’ to bring and appeal, and took away DHEC’s discretion in establishing setbacks from water sources. H.3929 was introduced by Representatives Hiott (R-Pickens), Pitts (R-Laurens), Kirby (D-Florence), Yow (RChesterfield), Sandifer (R-Oconee), Atkinson (D-Marion), and several others.

In the fall-out of the project, energy reform leaders in the House crafted the bill to create a Consumer Advocate who would argue for ratepayer protections in Public Service Commission rate-making cases.

This amendment defines imprudence and prudence in regard to utility contracts and cost decisions – establishing a clear standard or test for which expenses will be deemed “prudent” and may, therefore, be included in rates charged to customers. For example, many have argued that expenses on the VC Summer project were not prudent; therefore, these costs should not be passed on to ratepayers. The Base Load Review Act (BLRA) of 2007, in effect, gave near permanent prudency to all VC Summer related costs. The language in this budget amendment will help to avoid another VC Summer nuclear debacle and moves SC away from the utility-friendly system that was created with the misguided passage of the BLRA in 2007. The BLRA was pushed through the legislature in 2007 to allow utilities to charge ratepayers for nuclear generation projects before they were completed.

The facilities are left with acres of coal ash waste, which is the toxic byproduct from burning coal. Coal ash contains a litany of heavy metals that are known to bioaccumulate up the food chain, causing a potential threat to many Virginians that live downstream from a coal ash polluted waterway. Coal ash waste sits in ponds where the ash has settled to the bottom and is covered with millions of gallons of water. Often these ponds are unlined, meaning that there is little protection between the toxins and the ground. These ponds hold millions of tons of coal ash, have a bad record of leaking, and present a great risk to nearby surface and groundwater. Contamination has been reported at sites in Virginia, and the risk of excessive heavy metals like selenium, arsenic, and chromium puts communities at risk. In 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged this concern by issuing a rule to require the safe storage and disposal of coal ash units to protect the environment and public health, thereby giving Virginia the opportunity to lead the way and close sites in the most responsible and reasonable manner possible. Senate Bill 1398 stood out this session as it provided a legislative solution to Virginia’s coal ash problem. This bill requires Dominion to provide full, site-specific assessments of coal ash sites prior to closure. The assessments must be submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and the Chairs of the relevant Senate and House Committees before a coal ash permit is obtained by the utility. The assessments will include information about past contamination and coal ash disposal alternatives.
